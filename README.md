## Introduction

The project consists of a Python script that uses the minimax algorithm to create an AI player that is unbeatable in the game of Tic Tac Toe. The AI can play against a human player, providing a challenging experience for those who wish to test their skills.

## How to Run

To run the Tic Tac Toe AI game:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone  https://github.com/priyankeshh/TicTacToe-AI.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd unbeatable-tic-tac-toe-ai
    ```

3. Make sure you have Python 3 and Pygame library.


4. Run the game using:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Features

- **Unbeatable AI**: The AI uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, ensuring it does not lose the game.
- **Graphical Interface**: The game features a graphical user interface using the pygame library.
- **Play Modes**: Play against the AI in 'ai' mode or against another human in 'pvp' mode.
- **Reset**: Restart the game at any time using the 'r' key.
- **Toggle Game Mode**: Toggle between AI and PvP modes using the 'g' key.

## Files

- **`ai.py`**: Contains the implementation of the AI player using the minimax algorithm.
- **`board.py`**: Contains the implementation of the game board and game logic.
- **`constants.py`**: Contains constants for the game, such as window size, colors, and other settings.
- **`main.py`**: The main file that initializes the game, handles events, and runs the game loop.
